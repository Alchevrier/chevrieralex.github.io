My name is Alex Chevrier, a french Software Engineer based in Hong-Kong SAR China. I'm currently working as a consultant
for an international bank on a 24/7 FX+ product. The stack I'm currently working on is Java 11, Spring Boot, Oracle SQL, 
Websphere MQ deployed on a private cloud. 

I also have experience on the front-end and was a team leader of two amazing front-end engineer, working on a back-office application
for a reporting investment platform. We were using Typescript/Javascript, React, Webpack and deployed on Azure buckets. 

Recently my interest outside of work in the software area is around Java performance engineer and exploring how the JVM works. I would
also like to learn how to build iOS applications with the aim of releasing some projects next year! 

I spend most of my time taking care of my newborn and when I have some time spare like to indulge in some beginner calisthenics workout and video games.

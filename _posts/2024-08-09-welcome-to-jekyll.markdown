To me my journey as a Software Engineer has been full with experiences and lesson learned. From being a very energetic junior with absolutely no care in the world
on the journey ahead of me to where I am now and a better understanding of what has been taught to me during my uni days. I feel like what I missed the most is sharing
of information which unlocks one's mind to reach a next level of understanding. 

As a former manager who had my share of failures and successes, there is nothing better than going into a 1:1 and figuring out what is missing to the person in front of you
for them to have better result and then see them weeks after weeks getting dangerously closer to get you fired as they are getting much better! 

I hope that this will blog will help whoever is reading it to unblock themselves and help them reach the next level. 

Let's not forget, we all have plateau'd mutiple times in our career and sometimes it comes because we keep doing the things we are comfortable with because they work
but our job is not just making it work, it is also about understanding the tradeoffs and whether the decision made will impede us from reaching our long-term goals.

Thanks for your trust and support and happy reading!

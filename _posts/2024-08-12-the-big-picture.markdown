There is nothing more exciting than to get hands-on into the code and make things happen thinking we are going to add massive value to the company. 
Then somewhere down the line, things went south and now it takes a massive amount of time to get something done. Everything is a hassle and regressions are happening systematically when refactoring. 

It is not a race, no, being a top code contributor doesn't mean getting a raise and yes you need to understand that what matters is the company's bottom line. But it doesn't mean that it is barring you from achieving your personal goals, perhaps you have been focusing on tactics and not strategy. Fundamentals first, then elaborating a solution based on that. The bottom line is big picture is always achievable in any context, you just need to see the truth: every opportunity you are getting is a chance to climb the ladder, just open your mind to it and you will understand what next move you need to be making. 

You are master of your time, use it accordingly.
